# RPi SensorController

Simple example to handle multiple sensors attached to an RPi to read and save data.

The code is based upon the example found at <https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-max31865-rtd-pt100-amplifier/python-circuitpython>, but structured to handle multiple sensors.

Unfortunatelly, I don't have the hardware available and was not able to test the code with a real sensor.
